    p In order to play, tweet "play" to the evil dungeon mudd on Twitter. Then, tweet one of the following commands in order to play the game
    p "Fight": This allows you to attack the monster in the room with you.
    p "Flee": This allows you to run out of a room with a monster in it. The monster will continue to attack you as you leave until it misses you.
    p "Leave": This allows you to move out of an empty room.
    p Any incorrect command will cause the monster will attack you. The monster will also attack if it gets bored (i.e. you take too long to issue a command).
